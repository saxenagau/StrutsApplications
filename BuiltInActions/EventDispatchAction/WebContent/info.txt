In this EventDispatchAction Example to work properly you
need to pass the parameter along with the action value.
Ex

<html:form action="/op.do?add">
.....
.....
</html:form>

in the above example the name after the "?" sign is the 
parameter name which you are passing along with the action
value so that particular method get executed.
