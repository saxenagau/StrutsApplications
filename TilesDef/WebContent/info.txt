1. For successfully working of tiles definitaion you must configure
"chainConfig" init parameter with its value as "org/apache/struts/tiles/chain-config.xml"
in web.xml file. Bcoz it makes the tiles engine ready so
when you request for the particular definition it will able 
to process your request.

2. You need to configure "config" init parameter with its value 
"/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml"also by using that parameter 
container will load and instantiate all necessary
module configured by you in struts-config.xml file.
 
3. Its mandatory to configure <load-on-startup> parameter to work with
tiles so make sure you have configured that parameter as well.
